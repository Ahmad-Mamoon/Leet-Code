# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is organized into its own directory, named after the problem's ID or a brief description.

## Directory Structure

- **Problem_ID_or_Description/**
  - `solution.py`: Python file containing the solution code.
  - `README.md`: Explanation of the problem, approach, and any additional notes.

## How to Navigate

1. **Browse by Problem ID:**
   - Open the directory with the corresponding LeetCode problem ID to find the solution.
   - The `solution.py` file contains the Python code for the solution.
   - The `README.md` file provides details about the problem, the chosen approach, and any notes.

2. **Search by Description:**
   - If you're looking for a specific problem but don't remember the ID, check directories based on a brief description.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding more efficient solutions.
- Providing alternative approaches.
- Correcting any mistakes in the explanations.

## Notes

- Solutions are implemented in Python 3.
- For SQL, solutions are implemented in Microsoft SQL Server.
- Each solution is accompanied by a README explaining the problem and approach.

Happy Coding!
